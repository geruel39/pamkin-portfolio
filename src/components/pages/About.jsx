                    <p className="mb-5">We are a passionate group of IT students with a shared vision for creating impactful and innovative web solutions. Brought together by our mutual interest in technology and problem-solving, we’ve combined our individual strengths to form a well-rounded and driven development team.</p>
                    <p className="mb-5">Each of us brings a unique perspective — from frontend design and user experience to backend logic and database management. While we are still students, we’ve already completed a range of projects that reflect real-world needs and challenges, allowing us to apply our classroom knowledge in practical, hands-on ways.</p>
                    <p className="mb-5">Our journey is fueled by curiosity, collaboration, and a strong desire to keep learning. We treat every project as an opportunity to grow our skills, adopt new technologies, and deliver something we can be proud of — whether it’s for clients, our portfolio, or the community.</p>
